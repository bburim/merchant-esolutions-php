# Introduction
This package is an upgrade of original [package](https://github.com/opendns/merchant-esolutions-php) which has upgraded Guzzle version support.

Main reason why this fork was created is the fact that  Guzzle 3x is a little bit outdated. Some people want to use libreries which require GuzzleHttp 6. And they could not use them together with this library due to versions conflict.
